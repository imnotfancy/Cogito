# Requirements Specification: Reasoning Council Critique Module

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-06

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Reasoning Council Critique Module. The module's primary purpose is to provide a deep, objective critique of textual input, specifically targeting the content of `C:\git\hierarchical_reasoning_generator\goal.txt` in its initial application. The critique process leverages a simulated "Reasoning Council" employing diverse reasoning styles and self-correction mechanisms.

## 2. Functional Requirements

| FR-MOD-07   | The Reasoning Council MUST perform a self-critique phase where agents assess their own and others' critiques. | CRITICAL | Integration Test           |
| FR-MOD-08   | The module MUST synthesize the balanced critiques from the council into a single, final assessment.        | CRITICAL | Integration Test           |
| FR-MOD-09   | The final assessment output MUST be formatted as a string.                                                 | CRITICAL | Unit Test, E2E Test        |
| FR-MOD-10   | The final assessment MUST be presented in a highly objective, unempathetic, "robotic" tone.                | CRITICAL | Manual Review, E2E Test    |
| FR-MOD-11   | The module MUST explicitly handle the case where no significant points for improvement are found.          | CRITICAL | Unit Test, E2E Test        |

## 4. Assumptions

*   The underlying LLM or mechanism used to power the reasoning agents possesses the capability to adopt different reasoning styles and perform recursive analysis when prompted appropriately.
*   The Apex Software Compliance Standards Guide (`STANDARDS_REPOSITORY/apex/STANDARDS.md`) is accessible and provides the definitive ruleset.

## 5. Exclusions

*   This module is not responsible for *implementing* the underlying LLM reasoning capabilities, only for orchestrating their use according to the specified council structure and styles.
*   User interface development is excluded. The module provides a programmatic interface.
