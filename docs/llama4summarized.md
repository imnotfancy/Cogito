Llama4 Maverick is a large language model developed by Meta, released on April 5, 2025. It uses a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with 400 billion total parameters and 17 billion active parameters. The model supports multimodal tasks (text, image, video) and has a 1 million token context window.

Key capabilities include:
- Strong performance on benchmarks like MMLU, HellaSwag, ARC, and TruthfulQA
- Multimodal understanding and generation
- Multilingual support across 12 languages

Local execution requires significant hardware, but optimization techniques like quantization (e.g., GGUF, GPTQ) and CPU offloading can reduce memory needs. Inference engines like llama.cpp and vLLM are recommended for efficient deployment.

Community resources are available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Reddit, providing setup guides, quantized models, and troubleshooting tips.

Overall, Llama4 Maverick offers state-of-the-art performance in various AI tasks, making it a valuable tool for research and development.
