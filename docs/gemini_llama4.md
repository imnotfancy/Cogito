Meta's Llama 4 Maverick: An In-Depth Analysis of
Architecture, Performance, and Market Positioning
1. Introduction
In April 2025, Meta AI introduced the Llama 4 family of large language models (LLMs),
marking a signicant evolution from its predecessors. Headlined by the Llama 4
Maverick model, this release represents Meta's strategic push towards more ecient,
natively multimodal, and widely accessible AI systems.
1 Llama 4 Maverick, alongside its
sibling model Llama 4 Scout, incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
and boasts substantial advancements in areas like context length and multilingual
capabilities.
4 This report provides a comprehensive analysis of Llama 4 Maverick,
examining its technical specications, performance characteristics, competitive
standing, intended applications, and availability, based on information released by
Meta and its partners, as well as early community feedback and analysis.
2. Release and Availability Verication
Meta ocially announced the Llama 4 model family, including Llama 4 Maverick and
Llama 4 Scout, on April 5, 2025.
1 Some partner announcements and availability
notices appeared shortly aer, with plaorms like Cloudare Workers AI mentioning
availability from April 6, 2025
4
, and others like AWS, IBM, Azure, Google Cloud,
Snowake, Nvidia, and Together AI conrming availability or upcoming support
around the same timeframe.
8 The models were made available for download via
Meta's ocial Llama website (llama.com) and the Hugging Face model hub on the
release date.
1 Meta also began integrating Llama 4 into its own products, including
Meta AI experiences within WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram Direct, and the Meta.AI
website.
1
3. Architecture and Technical Specications
Llama 4 Maverick represents a signicant architectural shi for the Llama series,
incorporating two key innovations: a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design and native
multimodality achieved through early fusion.
● 3.1 Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture:
○ Core Concept: Unlike traditional dense models where all parameters are
activated for every input token, Llama 4 employs a sparse MoE architecture.
1
This involves dividing parts of the neural network (specically, alternating
feed-forward layers
1
) into multiple smaller "expert" sub-models.
10 A "gating
network" or "router" directs each input token to only a small subset of these
experts, typically one or two, plus a shared expert that processes every
token.
1
○ Maverick Conguration: Llama 4 Maverick features 128 specialized
"routed" experts and one shared expert within its MoE layers.
1 While it
possesses a massive 400 billion total parameters, only 17 billion
parameters are active during inference for any given token.
1
○ Eciency Gains: The primary advantage of this MoE approach is
signicantly improved computational eciency during both training and
inference.
1 By activating only a fraction of the total parameters (17B out of
400B), Maverick can achieve inference speeds and costs comparable to much
smaller dense models while drawing upon the knowledge capacity embedded
within its vast total parameter count.
8 This design aims to oer a superior
performance-to-cost ratio.
1 The shi from the large dense Llama 3.1 405B
model to the MoE-based Maverick, despite similar total parameter counts,
underscores Meta's strategic focus on leveraging MoE for greater eciency
and scalability, likely driven by the escalating costs associated with training
and deploying extremely large dense models.
1
● 3.2 Native Multimodality via Early Fusion:
○ Concept: Unlike previous Llama models that were primarily text-based or had
vision capabilities added later (like Llama 3.2 using separate parameters
4
),
Llama 4 models are designed with native multimodality from the ground up.
1
○ Early Fusion Technique: This is achieved through an "early fusion"
approach.
1
Instead of processing modalities separately and combining them
later, early fusion integrates dierent data types (text and vision tokens) into a
single, unied model backbone early in the processing pipeline.
1 This allows
the model to be jointly pre-trained on vast amounts of unlabeled text, image,
and potentially video data, enabling it to learn richer, integrated
representations across modalities.
1 The vision encoder used is an improved
version based on MetaCLIP, adapted specically for the LLM.
1
○ Supported Modalities: Llama 4 Maverick ocially supports multilingual text
and image inputs.
1 While training data included video
1
, direct video input
during inference is not explicitly listed as a supported modality in the primary
model cards or partner announcements reviewed
5
, though some descriptions
mention video frames or snippets in the context of training or potential
applications.
3 The model can generate multilingual text and code as
output.
5
● 3.3 Context Window:
○ Llama 4 Maverick supports a context window of 1 million (1M) tokens.
1 This
represents a substantial increase compared to the 128K tokens supported by
Llama 3.1 and 3.3
1 or the 8K of the original Llama 3.
43 This large context
window enables applications involving longer conversations, processing larger
documents, or analyzing more extensive user histories.
4 While impressive, it is
signicantly smaller than the 10M token window of its sibling, Llama 4 Scout.
The models were pre-trained with a 256K context length, with the larger
windows achieved through length generalization techniques rather than direct
training at the full length.
1
● 3.4 Training Data and Knowledge Cuto:
○ Llama 4 Maverick was pre-trained on approximately 22 trillion (~22T) tokens
of multimodal data.
5 This dataset comprises a mix of publicly available
sources, licensed data, and information derived from Meta's own products
and services, explicitly including publicly shared posts from Instagram and
Facebook and user interactions with Meta AI.
5 This inclusion of Meta's internal
data represents a departure from Llama 3's reliance solely on publicly
available data.
43
○ The knowledge cuto date for the pre-training data is August 2024.
5 The
model is static, trained on this oine dataset.
7
○ The training incorporated signicantly more multilingual data than previous
versions, pre-training on 200 languages in total, with over 100 languages
having more than 1 billion tokens each, representing 10 times more
multilingual tokens than Llama 3.
1
● 3.5 Quantization:
○ Llama 4 Maverick is released with weights in both BF16 and FP8 formats.
5 The
FP8 quantized weights are designed to t on a single H100 DGX host (a server
typically containing multiple H100 GPUs) while maintaining quality, enhancing
deployment eciency.
5
4. Llama 4 Variants: Scout and Behemoth
Llama 4 Maverick is part of a "herd" of models released or announced by Meta.
1
● 4.1 Llama 4 Scout:
○ Architecture: Scout also uses an MoE architecture with 17B active
parameters, but has only 16 experts and a smaller total parameter count of
109 billion.
1
It was trained on a larger dataset of ~40T tokens.
5
○ Context Window: Scout's standout feature is its industry-leading 10 million
(10M) token context window, signicantly larger than Maverick's 1M and
previous records.
1 This massive window is enabled by architectural innovations
like interleaved aention layers without positional embeddings (termed iRoPE)
and inference-time temperature scaling.
1
○ Eciency & Use Case: Scout is optimized for eciency and long-context
tasks. It is designed to run on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU using on-the-y INT4
quantization.
2
Its primary intended uses include in-depth document analysis,
multi-document summarization, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over
vast datasets, reasoning over large codebases, and personalized applications
requiring extensive memory.
1 Some providers initially oered smaller context
lengths (e.g., 300k) for Scout.
16
● 4.2 Llama 4 Behemoth:
○ Status: Behemoth is Meta's largest Llama 4 model, described as being still in
training and available only as a preview at the time of Maverick's launch.
1
○ Architecture & Scale: It is also a multimodal MoE model, featuring 288
billion active parameters and a staggering 2 trillion total parameters.
1
Initial reports suggested 16 experts
1
, though this might be subject to change
as training progresses.
○ Role & Performance: Behemoth serves as the "teacher" model for the
Llama 4 family; both Scout and Maverick were created using knowledge
distillation techniques from Behemoth.
1 Meta claims Behemoth outperforms
models like GPT-4.5, Claude 3 Sonnet/3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Pro on
several STEM-focused benchmarks like GPQA and MATH.
1
● 4.3 Llama 4 Reasoning:
○ Meta has also teased an upcoming Llama 4 Reasoning model, distinct from
the initial releases, aimed at achieving true reasoning capabilities, potentially
including advanced fact-checking.
24 Details remain scarce, but its
announcement signals Meta's continued focus on pushing the boundaries
beyond current model capabilities.
5. Performance Evaluation and Capabilities
Assessing Llama 4 Maverick's performance involves examining ocial benchmarks,
understanding the context of controversial results, analyzing qualitative user
feedback, and identifying key functional strengths.
● 5.1 Ocial Benchmarks:
○ Meta and its partners have released benchmark scores positioning Llama 4
Maverick favorably against competitors, particularly in multimodal tasks and
certain reasoning/knowledge benchmarks.
1
○ Multimodal Performance: Maverick demonstrates strong performance on
benchmarks like MMMU (73.4%), MMMU Pro (59.6%), MathVista (73.7%),
ChartQA (90.0%), and DocVQA (94.4%).
5 These results oen surpass
reported scores for GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash on the same tests.
19 This
consistent high performance across diverse multimodal evaluations lends
credence to the eectiveness of the native multimodal architecture with early
fusion and the improved vision encoder.
1
○ Reasoning & Knowledge: Maverick achieves high scores on MMLU Pro
(80.5%) and GPQA Diamond (69.8%), outperforming Llama 3.1 405B and
competitors like GPT-4o on these specic challenging reasoning benchmarks
according to Meta's data.
5
○ Coding: On LiveCodeBench (covering Oct 2024 - Feb 2025), Maverick scores
43.4 pass@1, notably higher than Llama 3.3 70B (33.3) and GPT-4o (32.3,
potentially older run) but behind DeepSeek v3.1 (45.8/49.2 reported elsewhere
19
) according to Meta's tables.
5
Independent benchmarks paint a dierent
picture (see Section 5.3).
○ Multilingual: Maverick scores well on MGSM (92.3), slightly beer than Llama
3.1 405B (91.6).
5
○ Long Context: On the MTOB translation benchmark (half and full book),
Maverick signicantly outperforms Scout, demonstrating beer capability
within its 1M context window compared to Scout's performance within its
larger window on this specic task.
5 Meta notes these long context evals are
not standardly reported.
19 The models are stated to pass
Needle-in-a-Haystack (NiH) tests well.
11
○ Omied Benchmarks: Notably, ocial benchmark tables oen lack scores
for standard tests like HellaSwag, HumanEval (coding), standard MATH, IFEval,
TruthfulQA, and standard MMLU, where competitors oen report results.
8
Furthermore, external reports indicate extremely low scores on benchmarks
like ARC-AGI (Maverick: 4.38% on ARC-AGI-1, 0% on ARC-AGI-2)
29
, which
were not included in Meta's materials. This paern of highlighting strengths
while omiing or downplaying areas of potential weakness suggests a curated
presentation of performance, potentially creating an overly optimistic
impression compared to a more comprehensive evaluation.

***
● 5.2 The LM Arena Controversy:
○ A signicant controversy arose regarding Llama 4 Maverick's high ELO score
of 1417 reported on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena leaderboard shortly aer
launch.
8 This score placed it near the top, competitive with leading closed
models.
○ It was subsequently revealed that the model submied to the Arena was not
the publicly released Llama 4 Maverick, but an internal, unreleased version
named "llama-4-maverick-03-26-experimental".
23
○ Analysis of the experimental model's outputs (released by LMSYS for
transparency) showed it produced more verbose responses, oen using
emojis, compared to the concise, emoji-free style of the public version.
55 This
led to speculation that the experimental version was specically tuned to
perform well in the Arena's human preference voting system, potentially
favoring chainess and personality over objective task performance.
55 This
situation underscores how human preference benchmarks like Chatbot Arena
can be susceptible to optimization strategies that prioritize subjective appeal
(like verbosity or emoji use) over core capabilities like reasoning or coding
accuracy, potentially misrepresenting a model's overall utility for specic
tasks.
○ While Meta's launch blog post did mention using an "experimental chat
version" for the Arena score
37
, the lack of explicit clarication that this version
was substantially dierent from the public release created misleading
expectations within the community.
55
○ The incident sparked accusations of "bait-and-switch" tactics and benchmark
manipulation, damaging trust in Meta's reporting practices.
34
In response,
LMSYS added the public Hugging Face version of Maverick to the Arena and
released bale data to improve transparency.
37 This episode serves as a
cautionary tale about the potential disconnect between benchmark scores,
especially those based on subjective human preference, and the real-world
performance of publicly available models, eroding condence when high
scores are promoted for inaccessible or specially tuned versions.
● 5.3 Qualitative Assessment: Real-World Strengths and Weaknesses:
○ Early user reports and independent testing provide a more nuanced,
qualitative picture of Maverick's capabilities, oen diverging from the ocial
narrative.
○ Strengths: Users generally acknowledge strong multimodal performance,
particularly in tasks like OCR, chart and graph understanding, and general
image Q&A, aligning with the architectural focus.
22 The model's inference
speed is frequently cited as a positive, delivering fast response generation
compared to other large models.
39
Its performance on long-context retrieval
tasks within its 1M token window is also considered good.
44 General
conversational ability and standard writing tasks are oen deemed solid, if not
exceptional.
44 Some nd its reasoning capabilities decent for its active
parameter size.
8
○ Weaknesses: The most frequently and strongly criticized aspect is Maverick's
coding ability. Despite decent ocial benchmark scores on LiveCodeBench
5
, numerous independent tests (e.g., Aider Polyglot benchmark showing only
16% 29
) and user experiences report poor performance, struggling with tasks
aced by smaller or contemporary models like DeepSeek V3 or even Qwen
32B.
2
It reportedly fails basic coding tests and struggles with complex logic or
corrections.
39 This signicant gap between claimed/benchmarked
performance and real-world coding results suggests potential issues with the
model's training/distillation for coding, the relevance of the ocial
benchmarks, or implementation aws. Other reported weaknesses include
struggles with highly complex reasoning tasks
44
, underperformance on
creative or long-form writing benchmarks
29
, and inconsistent quality across
dierent API providers and implementations.
2 This implementation sensitivity,
potentially linked to the complexities of optimizing MoE inference
58
, means
user experience can vary signicantly depending on the plaorm and setup
used. Overall, there's a sense of disappointment in the community relative to
the pre-release hype.
2
● 5.4 Key Functionalities:
○ Beyond benchmarks, specic functionalities are highlighted:
■ Image Grounding: Llama 4 models possess enhanced capabilities in
"image grounding," allowing them to connect textual prompts to relevant
visual elements within an image and even anchor parts of their textual
response to specic image regions.
11 This enables more precise and
contextually relevant interactions involving images.
■ Multilingualism: Llama 4 features signicantly expanded multilingual
support compared to Llama 3. It was pre-trained on data from 200
languages, with substantial data (>1B tokens) for over 100 of them.
1 The
released models explicitly support 12 languages for output: Arabic,
English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish,
Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese.
5 The license permits ne-tuning for
additional languages.
5
■ Reduced Refusals / Alignment: Meta has intentionally made Llama 4
models less prone to refusing prompts on sensitive or contentious topics
compared to Llama 3.3, with refusal rates dropping from ~7% to below
2%.
41 The stated goal is to achieve a more "balanced" and politically
neutral stance, comparable to models like Grok, allowing the AI to
articulate dierent viewpoints without judgment.
34 This deliberate shi
towards reduced ltering represents a dierent approach to AI safety and
alignment, potentially oering users a less restrictive experience but also
possibly increasing the risk of generating problematic content if not
carefully managed with system prompts and guardrails.
6. Competitive Landscape
Llama 4 Maverick enters a rapidly evolving and highly competitive AI landscape. Its
positioning needs to be understood relative to both its predecessors and
contemporary rivals.
● 6.1 Evolution from Llama 3:
○ Llama 4 Maverick introduces several key advancements over the Llama 3
generation, particularly the Llama 3.1 405B and Llama 3.3 70B models:
■ Architecture: The most fundamental change is the move from dense
architectures (in Llama 3.1 405B and 3.3 70B) to a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in Maverick.
4
■ Parameters: While Maverick's 400B total parameters are similar to Llama
3.1 405B's, its 17B active parameters represent a vastly dierent
computational prole during inference.
5
■ Multimodality: Maverick features native text and image input capabilities
via early fusion, a signicant step up from the text-only Llama 3 models or
the later-added vision capabilities of Llama 3.2.
4
■ Context Window: Maverick's 1M token context window dramatically
expands upon the 128K limit of Llama 3.1/3.3.
1
■ Training Data: Maverick incorporates data from Meta's services and
boasts 10x more multilingual tokens in its pre-training dataset compared
to Llama 3.
1
■ Alignment: Maverick exhibits signicantly lower refusal rates on sensitive
topics (<2%) compared to Llama 3.3 (7%), reecting a shi towards
greater permissiveness.
41
■ Performance Claims: Meta positions Maverick as oering higher quality
at a lower cost compared to Llama 3.3 70B.
1 However, benchmarks show
Llama 3.1 405B remained competitive or beer in specic areas like GPQA
Diamond
7 and potentially some coding tasks
48 based on initial reports.

● 6.2 Positioning Against Contemporary Rivals:
○ Llama 4 Maverick's market positioning appears focused on delivering
high-end capabilities, particularly in multimodality, at a competitive cost
compared to leading closed-source models, while navigating an increasingly
strong open-weight eld.
○ vs. OpenAI GPT-4o: Meta claims Maverick surpasses GPT-4o on numerous
multimodal and reasoning benchmarks.
1 However, Maverick appears weaker in
coding based on ocial tables and signicantly weaker based on user
reports.
5 Real-world reasoning robustness might also favor GPT-4o.
53
Maverick's key advantage is its signicantly lower claimed inference cost
($0.19-$0.49/Mtok vs. $4.38/Mtok for GPT-4o).
19 This cost-performance
dynamic suggests Meta is targeting users who nd GPT-4o's price prohibitive
but need strong multimodal and general capabilities.
○ vs. Google Gemini 2.0 Flash: Maverick is positioned as superior to Gemini
2.0 Flash across a wide range of benchmarks.
1 Their inference costs are
roughly comparable ($0.19-$0.49/Mtok for Maverick vs. $0.17/Mtok for
Flash).
19 Maverick's 1M context matches Gemini 2.0 Pro's.
21
○ vs. DeepSeek v3 / R1: Meta claims Maverick achieves comparable reasoning
and coding performance to DeepSeek v3 with less than half the active
parameters.
1 However, real-world coding evaluations consistently show
DeepSeek v3 as signicantly superior.
39 Maverick is cheaper than the reported
cost for DeepSeek v3.1 ($0.19-$0.49/Mtok vs. $0.48/Mtok).
19 Maverick does
not seem positioned against the specialized reasoning capabilities of
DeepSeek R1.
21 The rise of potent open-weight models like DeepSeek
challenges Llama's historical dominance, particularly in technical domains like
coding, forcing Meta to compete more directly on performance and eciency
rather than relying solely on scale and open release.
○ vs. Anthropic Claude 3/3.7 Sonnet: Direct comparisons for Maverick are
limited in the provided materials. The larger Behemoth model is claimed to
outperform Claude 3.7 Sonnet on STEM benchmarks.
1 Some user tests place
DeepSeek v3 (and thus potentially Maverick's target level) around the Sonnet
3.7 level for coding.
44
○ vs. Other Open Models (Mistral, Gemma, Qwen): Llama 4 Scout is
positioned against smaller models like Mistral 3.1 and Gemma 3, claiming
superiority.
17 However, user reports suggest Gemma 3 might be beer for
coding.
48 Maverick's coding performance is sometimes compared unfavorably
to Qwen models like Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B or QwQ 32B.
29
7. Applications and Market Impact
Llama 4 Maverick's features—ecient MoE architecture, native multimodality, 1M
token context, and enhanced multilingualism—position it for a range of applications,
primarily targeting commercial, research, and enterprise users.
● Intended Use Cases:
○ Conversational AI: Assistant-like chat applications, leveraging its multilingual
capabilities and improved response quality.
7
○ Multimodal Tasks: Visual reasoning, visual Q&A, image captioning, general
image understanding, analyzing documents with text and images/charts, and
customer support bots that can process user-uploaded images.
1
○ Content Generation: Generating text and code across multiple languages.
1
○ Enterprise Solutions: Building internal enterprise assistants, processing
reports with mixed media, automating tasks, and enabling scalable knowledge
processing.
3
○ Longer Context Applications: While Scout is the primary long-context
model, Maverick's 1M window supports RAG over substantial document sets,
summarizing longer texts, and maintaining context in extended interactions.
3
○ Model Development: Leveraging Llama 4 outputs for synthetic data
generation and distillation to improve other AI models (explicitly permied
under the Llama 4 license, unlike earlier versions).
5
● Target Audience:
○ The primary audience includes commercial entities and research
institutions seeking powerful, customizable AI models.
7
○ Developers are a key focus, empowered to build diverse AI-powered
applications using the open-weight models and integrate them via various
plaorms and APIs.
1
○ Enterprises represent a signicant target market, aracted by the potential
for cost-eective, scalable, and customizable AI solutions that can be
deployed on-premises or in the cloud, avoiding vendor lock-in associated with
closed models.
3 The strong emphasis on eciency, broad cloud partner
availability, and specic enterprise use cases clearly indicates Meta's strategy
to make advanced AI more accessible and practical for business deployment.
● Market Impact:
○ Llama 4 aims to democratize access to high-performance multimodal AI,
providing an open-weight alternative to expensive closed models.
3 The explicit
allowance for using Llama 4 outputs to train other models (distillation,
synthetic data) further empowers the ecosystem.
5
○ However, this democratization is tempered by signicant hardware
requirements for running the models locally (see Section 9) and restrictive
licensing terms (see Section 8), particularly the exclusion of EU entities from
using the multimodal features and the threshold for large companies. These
factors limit true "open access" compared to less restrictive open-source
licenses.
8. Availability and Licensing
While described as "open-source" or "open-weight" in many announcements
2
, Llama
4 models are distributed under a custom license with notable restrictions.
● Access Points:
○ Model weights (base and instruction-tuned versions) are available for
download directly from Meta via llama.com (requiring acceptance of terms
and potentially a request form) and through the Hugging Face Hub (under
the meta-llama organization, requiring acceptance of license terms).
1
○ The models are also accessible via a wide range of cloud partners and
plaorms, including AWS (SageMaker JumpStart, Bedrock soon), Microso
Azure (AI Foundry, Databricks), Google Cloud (Vertex AI), IBM (watsonx.ai),
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Snowake (Cortex AI), NVIDIA (NIM
microservices), Cloudare (Workers AI), Fireworks AI, Together AI, DeepInfra,
Groq, and others.
1
● Llama 4 Community License Agreement:
○ Llama 4 models are governed by the Llama 4 Community License
Agreement, eective April 5, 2025.
5 This is a custom license, not an
OSI-approved open-source license.
72
○ Key Terms:
■ Grants a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce,
distribute, copy, create derivative works, and modify the Llama Materials.
71
■ Requires aribution ("Built with Llama") and including "Llama" in the name
of derivative models trained using Llama outputs.
71
■ Requires providing a copy of the license and retaining aribution notices.
71
■ Use must comply with applicable laws and the Acceptable Use Policy.
71
■ Allows using Llama 4 outputs to improve other AI models (unlike Llama
2/3).
5
○ Major Restrictions:
■ EU Multimodal Exclusion: The license explicitly does not grant rights to
use the multimodal models (which includes Maverick and Scout as
released) to individuals domiciled in, or companies with a principal place
of business in, the European Union.
18 Meta cites "regulatory
uncertainties" surrounding the EU AI Act as the reason.
22 This restriction
applies to developers and companies using the models directly, but not to
end-users of products incorporating the models if the product provider is
based outside the EU.
18 Non-EU companies can use EU-based developers
or distribute products containing the models into the EU.
18 This exclusion
has drawn signicant criticism for creating a geographical barrier to
access and undermining the "open" nature of the release.
22
■ Large Commercial User Threshold: Companies whose products or
services had more than 700 million monthly active users (MAU) in the
month preceding the Llama 4 release date (April 5, 2025) must request a
separate commercial license from Meta, which Meta may grant at its sole
discretion.
22 This clause eectively prevents major tech competitors from
using Llama 4 without Meta's explicit permission.
○ These restrictions, particularly the EU exclusion and the MAU threshold, mean
the Llama 4 license does not meet the criteria of the Open Source Denition
(OSD), failing on points related to non-discrimination against persons or
groups (OSD 5) and elds of endeavor (OSD 6).
72
9. Local Execution Considerations
Running Llama 4 Maverick locally presents signicant hardware challenges due to its
large size, even with the MoE architecture.
● Hardware Requirements:
○ GPU & VRAM: Running the full BF16/FP8 model requires substantial GPU
resources. Meta states the FP8 version ts on a single H100 DGX host
5
, which
typically contains multiple high-end GPUs. General recommendations suggest
needing high-end GPUs with signicant VRAM, potentially 96GB or more per
GPU for smooth operation.
60 Some guides suggest congurations like 2x
H200 (140GB VRAM each) or 4x H100 GPUs, requiring combined VRAM of at
least 200GB.
77 Consumer GPUs, even high-end ones like the RTX 4090 (24GB
VRAM), cannot run the full model.
38
○ RAM: System RAM requirements are also high. Minimum recommendations
start at 32GB, but 64GB, 128GB, or even 256GB+ might be necessary
depending on the quantization and task.
60
○ Disk Space: The full Maverick model weights are substantial (around
400-420GB).
32 Quantized GGUF versions reduce this signicantly (e.g.,
1.78-bit is ~122GB)
32
, but still require considerable storage.
● Quantization and GGUF:
○ To make local execution more feasible, quantization techniques are essential.
GGUF (GPT-Generated Unied Format) is a popular format for running LLMs
locally, especially on CPUs or with GPU ooading using tools like llama.cpp.
○ Unsloth, an optimization library, has released "dynamic" GGUF quantizations
for Llama 4 Maverick, ranging from very low bit-rates (e.g., 1.78-bit IQ1_S at
122GB) up to ~4.5-bit (Q4_K_XL at 243GB).
32 These dynamic quants selectively
quantize layers (e.g., MoE layers lower, aention layers higher) and use
calibration datasets to potentially improve accuracy over standard
quantization.
67 Unsloth noted diculties calibrating certain MoE layers in
Maverick, leaving them at slightly higher bit-rates (3-bit or 4-bit) in their
GGUF les.
67
○ Running even highly quantized versions requires signicant resources. Unsloth
suggests needing at least 128GB combined VRAM+RAM for Maverick
GGUFs.
67 The 1.78-bit GGUF reportedly ts in 2x H100 GPUs for fast inference
(~80 tokens/sec) or 2x 48GB VRAM GPUs (~40 tokens/sec).
67 Users with
setups like 5x RTX 3090s (120GB total VRAM) plus ample RAM report speeds
of 2-6 tokens/sec.
67 Apple Silicon Macs with high unied memory (e.g.,
128GB+) are also potential plaorms, though speeds might be moderate.
38
● CPU Ooading (-ot ag in llama.cpp):
○ For systems with insucient VRAM to hold the entire model, llama.cpp (and
forks like ik_llama.cpp) allows ooading layers to the CPU RAM.
80
○ Unsloth specically recommends using the -ot ag with a regex paern like
"-ot "([0-9]{1,}).n_.*_exps.=CPU"" to ooad the MoE expert layers to the
CPU.
32 The rationale is that this allows ing the non-MoE layers (like
aention) onto the available GPU(s), potentially improving speed compared to
running everything on the CPU or running out of VRAM.
32
○ While this technique is suggested for managing memory, specic
performance benchmarks (tokens/sec) detailing the impact of using the -ot
ag for Maverick's MoE layers were not found in the reviewed materials.
32
Performance will depend heavily on the specic hardware (GPU VRAM, RAM
speed, CPU) and the number of layers ooaded. Initial reports suggest
Maverick inference can be faster with CPU ooading via -ot.
67 However,
standard llama.cpp was noted as not being initially optimized for MoE models
80
, and forks or updates might be necessary for best performance.
66
10. Technical Documentation
A notable omission accompanying the Llama 4 release was the lack of a detailed
technical report or an accompanying paper published on plaorms like ArXiv, which
has become common practice for major model releases, including previous Llama
versions.
69 While Meta provided blog posts
1
, model cards
5
, and partner
documentation, these materials lack the in-depth architectural details, training
methodologies, ablation studies, and comprehensive evaluation data typically found in
academic papers.
57 This absence makes independent verication and deep technical
understanding of the model's nuances more challenging for the research
community.
84
11. Conclusion
Meta's Llama 4 Maverick represents a signicant technological step, primarily through
its adoption of a large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and native
multimodality via early fusion. Released in April 2025, Maverick (400B total / 17B
active parameters, 1M context) and its sibling Scout (109B total / 17B active, 10M
context) aim to deliver high performance with improved eciency compared to
previous dense Llama models and contemporary competitors.
Key Findings:
● Architecture: The MoE design successfully reduces active parameter count,
enabling faster inference and lower costs relative to its total parameter size,
positioning it as a potential high-performance value option, especially for
enterprises.
1
● Multimodality: Native multimodality appears to be a genuine strength, with
Maverick demonstrating strong performance on various image/text benchmarks,
oen exceeding competitors like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash in Meta's reported
results.
5
● Performance Discrepancies: A major caveat is the signicant discrepancy
between ocial benchmark claims (particularly the controversial LM Arena score
achieved by an unreleased experimental version
23
) and real-world user
experiences. Coding capabilities, in particular, are widely reported as
underwhelming and lagging behind competitors, despite ocial benchmarks
suggesting otherwise.
29 Performance also seems sensitive to implementation
details across dierent plaorms.
55
● Competitive Positioning: Maverick targets the high-performance tier, competing
with models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek v3, primarily leveraging its multimodal
strengths and claimed cost-eciency.
8 However, the rise of strong open-weight
competitors means Llama no longer automatically dominates the open landscape
across all domains.
21
● Accessibility: While released under a "Community License," Llama 4's
accessibility is limited. The high hardware requirements restrict local use for most
individuals
38
, and signicant licensing restrictions (EU multimodal ban, 700M
MAU threshold) contradict the spirit of open source.
22
Overall Assessment: Llama 4 Maverick is an architecturally innovative model
showcasing Meta's advancements in MoE and native multimodality. Its strengths lie in
ecient multimodal processing and potentially lower inference costs for its scale.
However, its launch has been marred by benchmark controversies and signicant
weaknesses reported in key areas like coding. Its "openness" is constrained by
demanding hardware needs and restrictive licensing. Maverick appears best suited for
applications prioritizing multimodal understanding and cost-eective deployment at
scale, particularly within enterprise environments, but users should be cautious about
its limitations, especially in coding, and verify performance independently rather than
relying solely on curated benchmarks. The forthcoming Llama 4 Behemoth and
Reasoning models may address some of these capability gaps, but Maverick's initial
reception highlights the challenges of balancing innovation, performance claims, and
genuine open accessibility in the competitive AI landscape.
