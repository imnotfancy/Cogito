2025-04-11 23:53:30,666 - agent.ScientificExpertArbiter - INFO - Arbitration completed using o3-mini. Score=76. Found 2 adjustments.
2025-04-11 23:53:30,667 - agent.ScientificExpertArbiter - DEBUG - Arbiter Score Justification: The evaluated content exhibits a generally sound scientific methodology. Strong points include a rigorous systems analysis and well-defined boundary conditions, which contribute positively to the overall structural integrity. In contrast, empirical validation, while present, reveals certain gaps in testability criteria and falsifiability, and the optimization analysis could benefit from deeper refinement. Additionally, first principles analysis identified minor definitional weaknesses, and the logical structure analysis, although thorough, overemphasizes issues not critical in practical application. The integrated assessment, taking into account evidence across methodological frameworks, supports an overall scientific soundness score of 76 out of 100.
