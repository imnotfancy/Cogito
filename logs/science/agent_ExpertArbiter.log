2025-04-11 10:24:11,872 - agent.ExpertArbiter - DEBUG - Arbiter Score Justification: I, Dr. Livia Marquette, Ph.D. in Complex Systems & Nonlinear Dynamics from Sorbonne Universit√© with 18 years of research experience in fractal geometry and quantum mechanics, conclude that while the content is imaginative and ambitious, its heavy reliance on undefined, hyperbolic constructs and unsubstantiated claims significantly undermines its scientific credibility and methodological rigor. Each valid critique exposes critical gaps in clarity, logical structure, and empirical grounding, leading to an overall score of 20 out of 100.
