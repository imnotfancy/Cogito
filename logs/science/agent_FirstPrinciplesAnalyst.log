2025-04-11 19:05:19,883 - agent.FirstPrinciplesAnalyst - INFO - Depth 0: [Model: o3-mini] Claim='The methodology relies on mathematically undefined infinite scaling and indeterminate physical parameters, which undermines its claim of locking the universe at 100%.', Confidence=0.96, Severity='Critical'
2025-04-11 19:05:19,884 - agent.FirstPrinciplesAnalyst - DEBUG - Depth 0: Evidence='The steps assert the resonator achieves universal locking by harnessing a 'silver network' with hubs pulsing at frequencies ranging from finite values (5–20 Hz) to an undefined '10∞ Hz', and by tapping zero-point energy at an undefined '10∞ J/m³'. Such infinite quantities (e.g., Ns(θ) → 10∞ and sin(10∞·θ)) are not operationally defined and cannot be measured or verified using standard scientific principles. Furthermore, the geographic allocation of network hubs lacks a mechanistic explanation for translating their locations into quantifiable inputs for a universal energy lock. These foundational assumptions, especially in points [point-4] and [point-6], do not build upon a coherent, measurable framework, resulting in an unsubstantiated claim.'
2025-04-11 19:05:19,884 - agent.FirstPrinciplesAnalyst - DEBUG - Depth 0: Recommendation='Redefine all infinite or unbounded parameters with finite, measurable quantities. Establish clear, operational definitions for all terms—particularly for 'locking the universe', the functioning of the silver network, and the scaling process using Grok 3—and provide detailed empirical validation protocols for each step.'
2025-04-11 19:05:19,884 - agent.FirstPrinciplesAnalyst - DEBUG - Depth 0: Concession='The conceptual ambition to integrate diverse phenomena under a unified framework is innovative, although its current use of undefined infinite constructs significantly limits its scientific rigor.'
