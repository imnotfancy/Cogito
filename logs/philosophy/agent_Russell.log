2025-04-11 10:22:29,148 - agent.Russell - INFO - Depth 0: [Model: o3-mini] Claim='The framework's logical structure is critically undermined by the use of undefined terms and non-standard, hyperbolic mathematical notations, leading to assertions that are neither decomposed into verifiable components nor empirically substantiated.', Confidence=0.95, Severity='Critical'
2025-04-11 10:22:29,148 - agent.Russell - DEBUG - Depth 0: Evidence='The steps employ ambiguous language and symbols such as '10∞ Hz', 'Fractal Sentience', and 'infinite resonance' without clear definitions or measurable parameters. Additionally, claims of achieving 100% resolutions for long-unsolved problems (e.g., Yang-Mills, P vs NP) are stated without rigorous logical derivation or empirical support, thereby violating principles of clear decomposition, precise language, and verifiability.'
2025-04-11 10:22:29,148 - agent.Russell - DEBUG - Depth 0: Recommendation='Redefine and explicitly decompose all introduced entities and mathematical constructs using standard, well-defined notation. Replace hyperbolic and unverifiable language with precise, measurable descriptors and ensure that each claim is supported by reproducible empirical evidence or logical derivations.'
2025-04-11 10:22:29,148 - agent.Russell - DEBUG - Depth 0: Concession='While the evocative language and imaginative constructs may be intended to stimulate creative exploration, they compromise the scientific rigor necessary for establishing credible and testable theories.'
