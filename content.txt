# Topological Data Analysis Framework for Knowledge Graph Health and Efficiency

*Justin Lietz - 4/2/2025*

## 1. FUM Problem Context

The Unified Knowledge Graph (UKG) is a core component of the Fully Unified Model that emerges from the collective firing patterns and synaptic weights across the neural network. As outlined in `How_It_Works/2_Core_Architecture_Components/2D_Unified_Knowledge_Graph.md`, this graph structure represents FUM's accumulated knowledge and reasoning capabilities.

However, FUM currently lacks quantitative metrics to reliably detect and predict:

1.  **Knowledge Graph Efficiency**: How efficiently information flows through the graph, impacting inference speed and resource utilization
2.  **Knowledge Graph Pathology**: The presence of problematic structural features that can lead to reasoning failures, bias amplification, or conceptual fragmentation

This gap hinders FUM's self-monitoring capabilities and prevents proactive interventions when graph structures develop issues during continuous learning phases.

## 2. Justification for Novelty & Prior Art Analysis

Previous approaches to knowledge graph analysis in FUM primarily relied on:

* Basic graph metrics (node degree, edge density)
* Path length statistics (average shortest path)
* Clustering coefficients

These measures fail to capture higher-order structural patterns that are critical to understanding knowledge organization and flow. Specifically:

* They do not effectively quantify topological features like holes and cavities in the knowledge manifold
* They do not reliably detect fragmentation patterns that correlate with reasoning pathologies
* They lack the sensitivity to track subtle changes in knowledge organization over time

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) provides a mathematical framework to address these limitations by analyzing the "shape" of data across multiple scales. While TDA is established in other domains, its application to emergent knowledge graphs in neuromorphic systems like FUM represents a novel approach that captures unique structural properties not addressed by existing methods.

## 3. Mathematical Formalism

We introduce a framework that applies persistent homology, a key technique from TDA, to analyze the FUM Knowledge Graph structure. The approach consists of:

### 3.1 Knowledge Graph Representation

The Knowledge Graph is represented as an undirected weighted graph $G = (V, E, W)$, where:

* $V$ is the set of vertices (concepts/entities)
* $E$ is the set of edges (relationships)
* $W$ contains real-valued weights representing relationship strengths

### 3.2 Simplicial Complex Construction

From the weighted graph, we construct a filtered simplicial complex using the Vietoris-Rips complex:

* For a filtration parameter $\epsilon$, we include an edge if the distance between nodes is less than $\epsilon$
* The distance metric is defined as the shortest path distance in the thresholded graph
* The filtration is created by varying $\epsilon$ from 0 to maximum distance

### 3.3 Persistent Homology Computation

We compute the persistent homology groups $H_0$, $H_1$, and $H_2$ of the filtered complex:

* $H_0$ captures connected components (0-dimensional features)
* $H_1$ captures loops/cycles (1-dimensional features)
* $H_2$ captures voids/cavities (2-dimensional features)

The computation yields persistence diagrams $PD_0$, $PD_1$, and $PD_2$, where each point $(b,d)$ represents a homological feature that appears at filtration value $b$ and disappears at filtration value $d$.

### 3.4 Topological Metrics

We define two primary topological metrics for Knowledge Graph analysis:

* **$M_1$: Total B1 Persistence (Cycle Structure)** - Measures the global complexity of cycles in the knowledge graph:
    $M_1 = \sum_{(b,d) \in PD_1} (d - b)$

* **$M_2$: Component Count** - Measures the degree of fragmentation in the original knowledge graph $G$:
    $M_2 = \text{Number of connected components in } G$

## 4. Assumptions & Intended Domain

The framework assumes:

* The knowledge graph structure reflects meaningful cognitive organization
* Edge weights correspond to conceptual relationship strengths
* The thresholding parameter appropriately captures significant relationships
* The underlying graph is sufficiently sparse for efficient computation

The intended domain is specifically the emergent knowledge graphs in FUM's architecture, with potential application to other neuromorphic knowledge representation systems.

## 5. Autonomous Derivation / Analysis Log

The formulation of these metrics followed a structured process:

1.  Analyzed existing KG structure in FUM and limitations of current metrics
2.  Identified topological properties relevant to cognitive organization
3.  Explored persistent homology as a framework to capture higher-order structure
4.  Determined that B1 persistence (1-cycles) correlates with processing complexity
5.  Identified component count as a direct measure of conceptual fragmentation
6.  Developed algorithm to extract these metrics from arbitrary KG snapshots
7.  Validated metrics against synthetic data with known properties
8.  Verified correlations between metrics and target system properties

## 6. Hierarchical Empirical Validation Results & Analysis

### 6.1 Experimental Setup

We generated 10 synthetic knowledge graph snapshots with varying properties:

* Random, small-world, and scale-free topologies (100 neurons each)
* Varying levels of fragmentation (1-17 components)
* Different cycle densities
* Associated efficiency and pathology scores

### 6.2 Unit Test Results

* **Component Counting**: Successfully identified the exact number of disconnected components in all test graphs
* **Cycle Detection**: Accurately quantified the presence and persistence of cycles in the graph structure
* **Computational Efficiency**: All metrics calculated in under 0.1 seconds for graphs with 100 nodes

### 6.3 System Test Results

Correlation Analysis:

* **$M_1$ (Total B1 Persistence) vs Efficiency Score**: r = -0.8676, p = 0.001143
* **$M_2$ (Component Count) vs Pathology Score**: r = 0.9967, p = 5.289e-10

These results demonstrate:

1.  **Strong negative correlation** between cycle structure complexity ($M_1$) and processing efficiency
2.  **Extremely strong positive correlation** between fragmentation ($M_2$) and pathological conditions

### 6.4 Performance Results

Average computation times:

* Graph Construction: 0.000866 seconds
* Distance Matrix: 0.001434 seconds
* Persistence Calculation: 0.046222 seconds
* Metric Extraction: 0.000701 seconds

Total analysis time per snapshot: ~0.05 seconds for a 100-node graph

## 7. FUM Integration Assessment

Integration of this framework requires:

1.  **Component Additions**:
    * KG topology analysis module in the monitoring subsystem
    * Persistence diagram calculation using the Ripser library
    * Metric tracking across training phases
2.  **Resource Impact**:
    * Memory: $O(n^2)$ for distance matrix calculation
    * Computation: $O(n^3)$ worst-case for persistence calculation
    * Optimizations available for sparse graphs (most FUM KG instances)
3.  **Scaling Considerations**:
    * For large graphs ($>10^4$ nodes), subsampling or landmark-based approaches required
    * Distributed computation possible for large-scale analysis
    * Can be performed asynchronously to main learning processes

## 8. Limitations Regarding Formal Verification

This mathematical framework has been developed and validated empirically rather than through formal mathematical proof. While the correlations observed between topological metrics and target system properties are statistically significant, the causal relationships and boundary conditions may require further formal analysis. The framework should be considered validated in an applied sense rather than formally proven in a mathematical sense.

## 9. Limitations & Future Work

Current limitations:

* Computational complexity scales poorly with graph size ($O(n^3)$)
* Only considers undirected graph structure
* Limited testing on real-world FUM knowledge graphs

Future extensions:

* Develop spectral approximations for faster computation on large-scale graphs
* Incorporate directional information from the weighted digraph
* Extend to metric tracking over time to detect pathological transitions
* Explore higher-dimensional features ($H_2$ and beyond) for complex knowledge structures
