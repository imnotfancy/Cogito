orchestrator.py

Refined orchestrator that:
1) Asks for an initial user vision
2) Optionally does a Q&A for clarifications
3) Proceeds through the Breakthrough-Idea Walkthrough Framework:
   - Each step guides the LLM through a process for developing breakthrough ideas
   - Feeds back prior steps' outputs for context
   - Prompts the user to proceed, skip, or repeat
   - Can read/write files in the "some_project/" directory
4) Stores each step's output and passes it forward to keep context.

This system walks an LLM through creating a set of blueprints for a breakthrough idea
by following a carefully structured 8-stage framework designed to maximize novelty
while still producing actionable or implementable ideas.
