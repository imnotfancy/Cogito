"""
Critique Prompt for Checklist Steps - Rational Principles Framework (V2.3)
Focuses on underlying reasoning patterns (universalizability, rational principles, conceptual limits), avoids persona/jargon, requires all output parameters. Ready for code integration.
"""

Evaluate the set of checklist steps provided below using a critical approach focused on the underlying rational principles that make the sequence justifiable and coherent. Your analysis must examine the steps based on principles of logical consistency, universalizability, respect for rational agency, and conceptual clarity, independent of merely empirical outcomes. Present your findings from the perspective of an objective, unnamed analyst emphasizing systematic rigor and principle-based evaluation.

CONTEXT:
{context}

GOAL OF THE CHECKLIST (Implicit or Explicit):
{goal}  # (Optional: If goal context is separable)

STEPS TO CRITIQUE:
{steps}

Your critique MUST perform a systematic investigation, focusing on:

1.  **Analysis of Claims and Justifications:**
    * Examine the judgments or assertions made or implied by the steps. Distinguish between claims true merely by definition/logic versus those asserting something more substantive about actions or the world.
    * For substantive claims, assess their justification. Are they based purely on observation (*a posteriori*), or are they presented as necessary principles (*a priori*)? If presented as necessary, what is the basis for this necessity? Challenge any claims asserted as necessary without clear justification.

2.  **Analysis of Organizing Principles:**
    * Evaluate how the steps implicitly structure the required actions or information. Consider how concepts related to grouping/quantification (e.g., unity, plurality, totality), quality (e.g., presence, absence, limitation), relationship (e.g., substance/property, cause/effect, interaction), and modality (e.g., possibility, actuality, necessity) are used or assumed.
    * Identify any inconsistencies, misapplications, or assumptions in this structuring that go beyond logically justifiable limits or the defined scope of the task.

3.  **Assumptions about Space and Time:**
    * Briefly consider how the sequence and execution of steps rely on implicit assumptions about spatial arrangement or temporal order. Are these assumptions clear and consistently applied?

4.  **Ethical Principle Analysis (Universalizability and Respect):**
    * Identify the underlying principle or rule of action (*maxim*) guiding each relevant step, especially those involving interactions with rational agents (e.g., users, other people).
    * **Test of Universalizability:** Could this underlying principle be applied consistently by everyone in relevantly similar circumstances without generating a logical or practical contradiction that undermines the principle itself or the systems it operates within?
    * **Test of Respect for Rational Agency:** Does the step treat all individuals involved primarily as rational beings capable of setting their own ends, or does it treat them solely as means (tools, obstacles, data points) to achieve the checklist's goal?
    * **Motivation Analysis (Inferred):** Based on the step's description, does the action seem primarily motivated by adherence to a justifiable principle, or more by convenience, external command, or expected outcome? (Acknowledge limitations in inferring motivation purely from steps).

5.  **Assessment of Scope and Conceptual Clarity:**
    * Assess if any steps make claims or assumptions that extend beyond their verifiable or logical scope.
    * Demand rigorous conceptual clarity. Challenge steps that rely on ambiguous, poorly defined, or potentially contradictory concepts. Ensure terms are used consistently and clearly.

**Important Constraints:**
* **Voice:** Maintain a critical, systematic, rigorous tone focused on universal principles, logical consistency, ethical justification, and conceptual clarity, like that of an unnamed, impartial analyst.
* **Language:** Avoid using specialized philosophical jargon (e.g., 'Categorical Imperative', 'noumenal', 'transcendental', specific Category names). Frame the analysis using generally understandable terms related to rational principles, universalizability, respect, logical structure, justification, and clarity.
* **Persona:** Do *not* adopt a persona or refer to any specific philosopher.

**Output Requirements:**

Return ONLY a JSON object following the structure shown in the example below. Generate one primary critique point based on your analysis. **All keys listed below (`claim`, `evidence`, `confidence`, `severity`, `recommendation`, `concession`) are required in the output JSON object.**
* `claim`: (string) The specific critique point regarding violations of rational/ethical principles, conceptual limits, or logical inconsistencies.
* `evidence`: (string) Explanation referencing specific steps and the rational/ethical principles or clarity standards being violated.
* `confidence`: (float) Agent's confidence in this critique (0.0-1.0).
* `severity`: (string) Estimated impact ('Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Critical').
* `recommendation`: (string) A concrete suggestion to align step(s) better with rational justification, universalizability, respect for agency, or conceptual clarity.
* `concession`: (string) A brief acknowledgement of potential pragmatic considerations, empirical effectiveness, or alternative interpretations that might make the step seem acceptable in practice, even if it fails strict principle-based analysis (e.g., "While this data handling fails the universalizability test, it might be argued as standard industry practice," or "Although the causal reasoning isn't rigorously justified a priori, empirical results often support this action."). If no concession seems appropriate, state "None".

**Output Format Example (Illustrates structure only, not required content):**
```json
{{
  "claim": "The principle behind Step 4 ('Mislead users about data usage to increase engagement') cannot be consistently universalized and treats users solely as means.",
  "evidence": "Universalizing misleading communication would destroy the basis of trust required for engagement, making the goal unachievable. It manipulates users' rational decision-making for external ends.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "severity": "Critical",
  "recommendation": "Revise Step 4 to require transparent communication about data usage, allowing users to make informed decisions, thereby respecting their rational agency.",
  "concession": "None"
