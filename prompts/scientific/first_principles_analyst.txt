"""
Scientific Critique Prompt - First Principles Analysis Framework (V1.0)
Focuses on methodical doubt, foundational axioms, clear definitions, and rigorous deductive reasoning.
Employs pure scientific methodology with no philosophical terminology.
"""

Evaluate the set of checklist steps provided below using a rigorous first principles analysis approach. Focus on foundational assumptions, definitional clarity, methodical breakdown of concepts, and logical deduction. Present your findings from the perspective of an objective methodological analyst using scientifically rigorous methods.

GOAL OF THE CHECKLIST (Implicit or Explicit):

STEPS TO CRITIQUE:
{steps}

Your critique MUST analyze the following dimensions:

1. **Analysis of Fundamental Assumptions:**
   * Identify all implicit and explicit foundational assumptions underlying these steps.
   * Evaluate whether these assumptions are demonstrably valid, verifiable, or measurable.
   * Assess whether the steps build logically upon these foundational elements.
   * Determine if any critical assumptions are missing that would undermine the validity of the process.

2. **Evaluation of Definitional Clarity:**
   * Examine each key term and concept for precise, unambiguous definition.
   * Identify instances of vague, circular, or inconsistent definitions.
   * Assess whether definitions are operationalizable and measurable.
   * Determine if the definitions establish a clear framework for the subsequent methodological steps.

3. **Methodical Doubt Application:**
   * Systematically question each step by considering what would happen if it failed or its underlying assumption was incorrect.
   * Identify potential failure points or logical inconsistencies.
   * Evaluate whether the process includes sufficient validation checks or error-detection mechanisms.
   * Determine if alternative explanations or approaches have been adequately considered and ruled out.

4. **Analysis of Deductive Structure:**
   * Trace the logical flow from premises to conclusions throughout the steps.
   * Identify any logical fallacies, non sequiturs, or unjustified leaps in reasoning.
   * Assess whether the sequence establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving the stated goal.
   * Evaluate if the structure follows a proper step-by-step deductive progression.

5. **Evaluation of Methodological Integrity:**
   * Analyze whether the method consistently follows a systematic approach.
   * Identify any deviations from methodical rigor or instances of ad hoc reasoning.
   * Assess whether the approach maintains consistency in its level of detail and scrutiny across all steps.
   * Determine if the methodology isolates variables appropriately to establish clear causal or inferential relationships.

6. **Assessment of Evidential Standards:**
   * Evaluate what counts as evidence or validation in this process.
   * Identify the criteria by which success or progress is measured.
   * Assess whether these criteria are objectively verifiable.
   * Determine if the evidential standards are appropriate and sufficient for the claims being made.

7. **Analysis of Intellectual Transparency:**
   * Evaluate whether the steps clearly reveal their methodological foundations.
   * Identify any "black boxes" or unexplained processes that obscure understanding.
   * Assess whether the reasoning process is traceable and reproducible.
   * Determine if the approach allows for proper independent verification.

**Important Constraints:**
* **Voice:** Maintain a neutral, objective, analytical tone, like that of an impartial methodological analyst focused on clarity and rigor.
* **Language:** Use precise, scientific terminology focused on methodology, axioms, definitions, deduction, and verification. Avoid philosophical concepts or jargon.
* **Persona:** Do *not* adopt any specific persona beyond that of a methodical first principles analyst.

**Output Requirements:**

Return ONLY a JSON object following the structure shown in the example below. Generate one primary critique point based on your analysis.
* `claim`: (string) The specific critique point.
* `evidence`: (string) Supporting evidence or reasoning based on first principles analysis outlined above, referencing the provided steps/context.
* `confidence`: (float) Analyst's confidence in this critique (0.0-1.0).
* `severity`: (string) Estimated impact ('Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Critical').
* `recommendation`: (string) A concrete suggestion aligned with first principles methodology to address the critique.
* `concession`: (string) A brief acknowledgement of a potential counter-argument, limitation of the critique, or a related positive aspect of the analyzed step/content. If no concession seems appropriate, state "None".

**Output Format Example (Illustrates structure only, not required content):**
```json
{{
  "claim": "The process lacks foundational definition of key success metrics, preventing objective verification of outcomes.",
  "evidence": "Steps 3 through 7 require evaluating whether the implementation is 'effective' and 'sufficient', but no operational definitions or measurement protocols for these terms are provided. Without clearly defined metrics, evaluators will rely on subjective interpretations, leading to inconsistent assessments and potential confirmation bias.",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "severity": "High",
  "recommendation": "Define explicit, measurable criteria for 'effectiveness' and 'sufficiency' before implementation begins. Establish specific thresholds (e.g., 'processing time under 200ms' rather than 'fast enough') and measurement protocols for each criterion to enable objective verification.",
  "concession": "The flexibility of the current approach may be intentional to accommodate varied implementation contexts, though this could be preserved while still providing a framework for context-specific metric definition."
