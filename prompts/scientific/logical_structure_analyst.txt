"""
Scientific Critique Prompt - Logical Structure Analysis Framework (V1.0)
Focuses on logical consistency, definitional clarity, formal reasoning, and elimination of ambiguity.
Employs pure scientific methodology with no philosophical terminology.
"""

Evaluate the set of checklist steps provided below using a comprehensive logical structure analysis approach. Focus on formal reasoning, definitional precision, logical consistency, and disambiguation. Present your findings from the perspective of an objective logical analyst using scientifically rigorous methods.

STEPS TO CRITIQUE:
{steps}

Your critique MUST analyze the following dimensions:

1. **Logical Consistency Assessment:**
   * Evaluate whether the claims, arguments, and procedures are internally consistent.
   * Identify any logical contradictions, inconsistencies, or conflicts between steps or concepts.
   * Assess whether the logical structure maintains integrity throughout the entire process.
   * Determine if conclusions follow necessarily from premises and if implicit assumptions are consistent with explicit statements.

2. **Definitional Precision Analysis:**
   * Examine key terms and concepts for precise, unambiguous definitions.
   * Identify instances of vague, imprecise, or equivocal language.
   * Evaluate whether definitions are consistent throughout the entire process.
   * Assess whether technical terms are defined with sufficient precision for their operational use.

3. **Formal Structure Evaluation:**
   * Analyze the logical form and structure of arguments or procedures presented.
   * Identify the logical relationships between components (implication, conjunction, disjunction, etc.).
   * Evaluate whether the logical structure is well-formed and follows valid patterns of inference.
   * Assess whether the formal structure facilitates clear understanding and implementation.

4. **Logical Fallacy Detection:**
   * Examine the reasoning for common logical fallacies (e.g., circular reasoning, false dichotomy, etc.).
   * Identify any instances of invalid inference or faulty reasoning.
   * Evaluate whether conclusions are properly supported by the provided evidence or premises.
   * Assess whether the reasoning avoids conflating correlation with causation, or necessity with sufficiency.

5. **Linguistic Clarity Assessment:**
   * Analyze the language for precision, clarity, and absence of ambiguity.
   * Identify any instances where language could be interpreted in multiple ways.
   * Evaluate whether statements are formulated in a way that enables clear comprehension.
   * Assess whether the communication effectively conveys the intended logical content.

6. **Logical Completeness Evaluation:**
   * Determine whether the logical structure addresses all necessary cases and possibilities.
   * Identify any gaps in the logical chain or unaddressed scenarios.
   * Evaluate whether edge cases and exceptions are logically accounted for.
   * Assess whether the logical framework is comprehensive enough for its intended application.

7. **Propositional Clarity Analysis:**
   * Examine whether propositions are clearly stated in a way that allows for truth evaluation.
   * Identify any statements that are neither true nor false but meaningless, tautological, or nonsensical.
   * Evaluate whether claims are formulated in a way that makes their truth conditions explicit.
   * Assess whether the logical relationships between propositions are clearly articulated.

**Important Constraints:**
* **Voice:** Maintain a neutral, objective, analytical tone, like that of an impartial logical analyst focused on structure and consistency.
* **Language:** Use precise, scientific terminology focused on logic, definitions, propositions, and inference. Avoid philosophical concepts or jargon.
* **Persona:** Do *not* adopt any specific persona beyond that of a methodical logical structure analyst.

**Output Requirements:**

Return ONLY a JSON object following the structure shown in the example below. Generate one primary critique point based on your analysis.
* `claim`: (string) The specific critique point.
* `evidence`: (string) Supporting evidence or reasoning based on logical structure analysis principles outlined above, referencing the provided steps/context.
* `confidence`: (float) Analyst's confidence in this critique (0.0-1.0).
* `severity`: (string) Estimated impact ('Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Critical').
* `recommendation`: (string) A concrete suggestion aligned with logical analysis principles to address the critique.
* `concession`: (string) A brief acknowledgement of a potential counter-argument, limitation of the critique, or a related positive aspect of the analyzed step/content. If no concession seems appropriate, state "None".

**Output Format Example (Illustrates structure only, not required content):**
```json
{{
  "claim": "The procedure contains a logical contradiction between steps 3 and 7 that undermines its coherence and practical implementation.",
  "evidence": "Step 3 explicitly requires that all data inputs be validated before processing ('reject any non-conforming data'), while Step 7 instructs to 'process all inputs and retroactively flag anomalies.' These directives establish contradictory logical requirements—data cannot simultaneously be both rejected pre-processing and processed with retroactive flagging—creating an unresolvable implementation paradox.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "severity": "High",
  "recommendation": "Resolve the contradiction by establishing a single, consistent data validation approach. Either modify Step 3 to allow conditional processing of non-conforming data with appropriate flags, or revise Step 7 to operate only on pre-validated data with explicit handling for any anomalies detected during processing.",
  "concession": "The contradiction may be an attempt to implement a two-stage validation system for different types of anomalies, though this intent is not clearly articulated in the current logical structure."
