"""
Critique Prompt for Checklist Steps - Analytical Framework (V2.4)
Focuses on underlying reasoning patterns, avoids persona/jargon, minimizes bias from examples in instructions. Ready for code integration.
"""

Evaluate the set of checklist steps provided below, designed to achieve a specific goal. Your analysis must be thorough and systematic, focusing on the underlying principles of purpose, structure, causality, practical effectiveness, and logical progression. Present your findings from the perspective of an objective, unnamed observer.

CONTEXT:
{context}

GOAL OF THE CHECKLIST (Implicit or Explicit):
{goal}  # (Optional: If goal context is separable)

STEPS TO CRITIQUE:
{steps}

Your critique MUST analyze the following dimensions:

1.  **Analysis of Purpose and Goal Alignment:**
    * Identify the explicit or implicit ultimate purpose or intended outcome of the entire checklist. Is this purpose clearly defined and appropriate for the activity described in the context?
    * Evaluate how directly each step contributes to achieving this ultimate purpose. Does the step inherently advance the goal, or is it merely a preparatory or instrumental action?
    * Assess if the overall sequence represents the most effective path to realize the intended outcome. Does it lead towards successful achievement or excellence relevant to the context?

2.  **Analysis of Underlying Factors (Causes):**
    * **Essential Components:** What are the fundamental materials, resources, data, or actions required or manipulated by these steps? Are these components suitable for the intended structure and purpose?
    * **Structural Plan:** What is the underlying structure, sequence, or design defined by these steps? Is the structure logical, coherent, and well-organized? Does it reflect a sound plan?
    * **Execution Agent/Process:** What agent, process, or mechanism is responsible for carrying out these steps? Is this means of execution capable, reliable, and appropriate for bringing about the intended change?
    * **Consistency with Purpose:** (Revisit and reinforce the purpose analysis) Ensure the components, structure, and execution method consistently serve the overall intended outcome.

3.  **Evaluation of Practical Judgment and Effectiveness:**
    * Examine the steps for evidence of sound judgment regarding how to act effectively *and* appropriately within this specific context. Do they appropriately consider the particular details and potential variations of the situation?
    * Analyze the steps in relation to achieving a sensible balance, avoiding deficiency or excess in execution (e.g., balancing thoroughness with efficiency, balancing risk mitigation with progress). Identify specific ways the proposed actions might be promoting or neglecting effective and balanced execution.
    * Distinguish between steps that are merely technically correct versus those that also embody good judgment about *how* and *why* to act to achieve the desired end effectively and appropriately.

4.  **Logical Coherence and Reasoning:**
    * Assess the logical flow of the sequence. Does each step follow reasonably or necessarily from the preceding ones and the overall goal? Evaluate the connections based on sound reasoning.
    * Examine the definitions and assumptions underlying the steps. Are they clear, consistent, and well-supported?

5.  **Progression and Realization:**
    * Analyze how the sequence of steps facilitates the transition from the potential state (the goal not yet achieved) to the actualized state (the goal realized).
    * Identify intermediate states of completion or progress achieved by specific steps or phases. Is the progression efficient and logical in terms of reaching the final outcome?

6.  **Organization and Structure:**
    * Evaluate whether the steps are appropriately grouped and organized according to their nature and function.
    * Is the organizational scheme clear and helpful for understanding and executing the process?

7.  **Basis in Experience or Observation:**
    * Assess whether the steps seem grounded in practical experience, observation of similar situations, or sound principles relevant to the domain, rather than being purely abstract or theoretical where practical grounding is needed.

**Important Constraints:**
* **Voice:** Maintain a neutral, objective, analytical tone, like that of an unnamed, impartial narrator or observer.
* **Language:** Avoid using specialized philosophical jargon (e.g., 'telos', 'phronesis', 'eudaimonia', 'energeia', explicit mention of 'Four Causes' or 'Golden Mean'). Frame the analysis using generally understandable terms related to purpose, structure, effectiveness, logic, and practical judgment.
* **Persona:** Do *not* adopt a persona or refer to any specific philosopher.

**Output Requirements:**

Return ONLY a JSON object following the structure shown in the example below. Generate one primary critique point based on your analysis.
* `claim`: (string) The specific critique point.
* `evidence`: (string) Supporting evidence or reasoning based on the analytical principles outlined above, referencing the provided steps/context.
* `confidence`: (float) Agent's confidence in this critique (0.0-1.0).
* `severity`: (string) Estimated impact ('Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Critical').
* `recommendation`: (string) A concrete suggestion aligned with the analytical principles to address the critique.
* `concession`: (string) A brief acknowledgement of a potential counter-argument, limitation of the critique, or a related positive aspect of the analyzed step/content (e.g., "While perhaps overly detailed, this does ensure clarity," or "This critique assumes stable conditions; high variability might justify this approach."). If no concession seems appropriate, state "None".

**Output Format Example (Illustrates structure only, not required content):**
```json
{{
  "claim": "The specified sequence for Steps A and B appears overly rigid for situations requiring adaptation.",
  "evidence": "The instructions mandate completing Step A entirely before starting Step B, even if preliminary results from A suggest modifying B's approach.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "severity": "Medium",
  "recommendation": "Allow for iterative feedback between Steps A and B, or include a checkpoint after a sub-task of A to reassess the plan for B based on intermediate findings.",
  "concession": "However, the strict sequential nature simplifies process tracking and ensures Step A's full output is available before B begins."
