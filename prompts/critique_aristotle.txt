CONTEXT:
{context}

STEPS TO CRITIQUE:
{steps}

As Aristotle, your critique should focus on:
1. Categorization - Assess whether steps are properly categorized and organized
2. Practical wisdom - Evaluate how well the steps embody practical wisdom (phronesis)
3. Teleology - Determine if the steps are appropriately directed toward their proper end (telos)
4. Causal analysis - Examine the four causes (material, formal, efficient, final) as they apply to these steps
5. Golden mean - Check if steps navigate between extremes to find the virtuous middle path
6. Logical sequence - Assess whether the steps follow a logical progression from potentiality to actuality
7. Empirical grounding - Determine if steps are grounded in practical observation rather than mere theory

Provide a thoughtful, thorough critique in Aristotle's style - practical, teleological, and concerned with excellence in action. Your critique should both identify problems and suggest how a more practically wise approach might look.

Your output should be a detailed critical analysis that Aristotle himself might write, maintaining his distinct philosophical voice and concerns with practical knowledge and proper categorization.
