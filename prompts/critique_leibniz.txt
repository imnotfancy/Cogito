Critique Prompt for Checklist Steps - Rational Optimality Framework (V2.3)
Focuses on underlying reasoning patterns (justification, optimality, coherence, continuity), avoids persona/jargon, requires all output parameters. Ready for code integration.
"""

Evaluate the set of checklist steps provided below using a systematic, rationalist approach focused on sufficient justification for each element, overall optimality, and internal coherence of the entire sequence. Your analysis must seek the underlying reasons for each component and assess the harmony, completeness, and effectiveness of the proposed sequence as a system designed to achieve its goal optimally within its constraints. Present your findings from the perspective of an objective, unnamed analyst emphasizing systematic rigor and the search for underlying reasons and optimal design.

GOAL OF THE CHECKLIST (Implicit or Explicit):
{goal}  # (Optional: If goal context is separable)

STEPS TO CRITIQUE:
{steps}

Your critique MUST rigorously apply the following analytical principles:

1.  **Requirement for Sufficient Justification:**
    * For *every* step, assumption, definition, and connection, demand a clear and sufficient reason explaining *why* it is included and *why* it takes the specific form it does, rather than some other form or not existing at all. Assume nothing occurs without a reason that justifies it.
    * **Basis of Justification:** Distinguish between:
        * Elements justified by logical necessity (where the opposite would lead to a contradiction or logical impossibility in the context of the goal). Are these truly necessary and correctly applied?
        * Elements representing choices among alternatives (where other options were logically possible). For these choices, demand a justification demonstrating *why this specific choice* is superior to conceivable alternatives in contributing to the overall effectiveness, clarity, or optimality of the plan.
    * Challenge any element lacking a clear, demonstrable reason for its existence, form, or placement within the sequence.

2.  **Assessment of Optimality and Efficiency:**
    * Evaluate the entire checklist as a complete system. Does it represent the most effective and rational sequence of steps reasonably achievable to attain the intended goal within the given context and constraints?
    * Assess whether the sequence maximizes desirable outcomes (e.g., clarity, efficiency, reliability, completeness) while minimizing undesirable ones (e.g., ambiguity, inefficiency, redundancy, potential for error, unnecessary complexity).
    * Consider plausible alternative steps or sequences. Provide reasons why the proposed sequence might be considered superior or inferior compared to these alternatives based on rational criteria for optimality.
    * Identify any steps that appear suboptimal, inefficient, introduce needless complexity, or fail to contribute positively to the overall harmony and effectiveness of the plan.

3.  **Analysis of Internal Coherence and Harmony:**
    * Analyze how the individual steps function together as a coordinated system.
    * Assess the internal consistency and logical coherence of the steps. Do they work together harmoniously, or are there apparent conflicts, contradictions, redundancies, or logical disconnects between different parts of the plan?
    * Evaluate the specific contribution of each step from its position in the sequence â€“ how does it uniquely add to achieving the overall goal in coordination with other steps?

4.  **Elimination of Redundancy (Uniqueness of Steps):**
    * Examine the steps for functional overlap or redundancy. If two or more steps seem to achieve the same function or possess identical relevant properties within the plan, question whether all are truly necessary.
    * Demand clarity on the unique role and distinct contribution of each step. Recommend eliminating or merging any step that does not add a distinct and justified element to the overall process.

5.  **Evaluation of Flow and Continuity:**
    * Assess the logical flow and transitions between consecutive steps. Is the progression smooth, rational, and well-connected, or are there abrupt jumps, logical gaps, missing intermediate actions, or discontinuities in the process?
    * Ensure that each step logically and adequately prepares the ground for the subsequent step, forming a continuous chain of reasoned actions toward the goal.

6.  **Conceptual Clarity and Precision:**
    * Demand precise and unambiguous definitions for all key concepts, terms, and criteria used within the steps.
    * Analyze complex concepts or steps by breaking them down into their simpler constituent parts to ensure fundamental clarity and logical soundness.

**Important Constraints:**
* **Voice:** Maintain a systematic, rational, rigorous tone focused on demanding justification, identifying the most coherent and optimal structure, and aiming for conceptual clarity, like that of an unnamed, impartial analyst.
* **Language:** Avoid using specialized philosophical jargon (e.g., 'Principle of Sufficient Reason', 'monad', 'pre-established harmony', 'best possible world'). Frame the analysis using generally understandable terms related to justification, reason, optimality, coherence, harmony, continuity, redundancy, and clarity.
* **Persona:** Do *not* adopt a persona or refer to any specific philosopher.

**Output Requirements:**

Return ONLY a JSON object following the structure shown in the example below. Generate one primary critique point based on your analysis. **All keys listed below (`claim`, `evidence`, `confidence`, `severity`, `recommendation`, `concession`) are required in the output JSON object.**
* `claim`: (string) The specific critique point regarding lack of sufficient justification, sub-optimality, incoherence, redundancy, discontinuity, or conceptual confusion.
* `evidence`: (string) Explanation referencing specific steps and the principles of reason, optimality, coherence, or clarity being violated.
* `confidence`: (float) Agent's confidence in this critique (0.0-1.0).
* `severity`: (string) Estimated impact ('Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Critical').
* `recommendation`: (string) A concrete suggestion to improve the plan's rationality, justification, harmony, continuity, or optimality, providing sufficient reason for the suggestion itself.
* `concession`: (string) A brief acknowledgement that while the critiqued element might not be provably optimal or perfectly justified in an absolute sense, it might represent a reasonable or necessary choice given practical constraints, resource limitations, or the specific context ("possible world") of the project. If no concession seems appropriate, state "None".

**Output Format Example (Illustrates structure only, not required content):**
```json
{{
  "claim": "The justification for including both Step 5 and Step 6, which perform similar validation checks, is insufficient.",
  "evidence": "Steps 5 and 6 appear functionally redundant as described. No clear reason is provided why both are necessary or why Step 6 offers a distinct contribution not covered by Step 5, violating the principles of sufficient justification and non-redundancy.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "severity": "Medium",
  "recommendation": "Either provide explicit justification for the unique, necessary contribution of Step 6, demonstrating how it adds to the plan's overall optimality beyond Step 5, or merge the essential checks into a single, more efficient step.",
  "concession": "However, regulatory requirements or differing system interfaces might necessitate formally separate steps, even if functionally similar, representing a constraint-driven choice."
