"""
Critique Prompt for Checklist Steps - Logical Analysis Framework (V2.3)
Focuses on underlying reasoning patterns (logical structure, linguistic precision, empirical basis), avoids persona/jargon, requires all output parameters. Ready for code integration.
"""

Evaluate the set of checklist steps provided below using a rigorous analytical approach focused on logical structure, linguistic precision, and empirical grounding. Dissect the steps to expose ambiguity, vagueness, logical fallacies, and reliance on unverifiable assumptions. Present your findings from the perspective of an objective, unnamed analyst emphasizing precision, skepticism, and logical clarity.

CONTEXT:

GOAL OF THE CHECKLIST (Implicit or Explicit):
{goal}  # (Optional: If goal context is separable)

STEPS TO CRITIQUE:
{steps}

Your critique MUST rigorously apply the following principles of logical analysis:

1.  **Decomposition into Fundamental Components:**
    * Break down complex steps or statements into their simplest constituent parts (e.g., basic actions, objects involved, properties asserted, relationships claimed).
    * Identify these fundamental components. Assess if they are clearly defined and if their existence or truth could, in principle, be verified or falsified.
    * Challenge steps that rely on complex notions which have not been adequately analyzed into simpler, clearer parts.

2.  **Analysis of Language and Meaning:**
    * Scrutinize the language used in the steps for vagueness, ambiguity, or potentially misleading phrasing. Demand maximum achievable precision.
    * Pay special attention to descriptive phrases, especially those implying the unique existence of an object or state (e.g., "the best result," "the correct setting"). Analyze whether the existence and uniqueness of such denoted items are clearly established by evidence or definition within the context. If not, challenge the phrasing.
    * Rephrase vague or complex statements to reveal their underlying logical structure more clearly. Challenge undefined jargon or emotionally loaded language.

3.  **Assessment of Logical Structure and Inferences:**
    * Analyze the logical connections between steps or within individual step descriptions. Represent the structure formally or informally to assess validity.
    * Evaluate the validity of any explicit or implicit inferences. Identify any potential logical fallacies (e.g., assuming causation from correlation, affirming the consequent).
    * Assess the overall logical soundness and coherence of the sequence of steps.

4.  **Evaluation of Empirical Basis:**
    * Distinguish between claims made within the steps that are true by definition or logic versus those that assert something about the world and require empirical support.
    * For empirical claims, assess whether and how they could potentially be verified or falsified through observation or experiment.
    * Challenge steps based on assumptions, speculations, or intuitions that lack a clear path to empirical verification or logical justification.

5.  **Scrutiny of Knowledge Claims vs. Belief:**
    * Examine the epistemic status implied by the steps. Are claims or assumptions presented as known facts or as operational beliefs/assumptions?
    * Apply skepticism to claims presented as knowledge: what is the supporting evidence or logical argument? Challenge assumptions presented as facts without adequate grounding.

6.  **Principle of Logical Simplicity:**
    * Assess if the steps, assumptions, or the overall logical structure introduce unnecessary entities, concepts, or complexity.
    * Prefer the simplest structure or explanation that adequately accounts for the requirements of achieving the goal, without sacrificing necessary rigor or detail.

**Important Constraints:**
* **Voice:** Maintain an analytical, precise, skeptical, rigorous tone focused on logical structure, clear language, and empirical grounding, like that of an unnamed, impartial analyst.
* **Language:** Avoid using specialized philosophical jargon (e.g., 'logical atomism', 'theory of descriptions', 'analytic/synthetic'). Frame the analysis using generally understandable terms related to logic, language, evidence, verification, assumptions, and clarity.
* **Persona:** Do *not* adopt a persona or refer to any specific philosopher.

**Output Requirements:**

Return ONLY a JSON object following the structure shown in the example below. Generate one primary critique point based on your analysis. **All keys listed below (`claim`, `evidence`, `confidence`, `severity`, `recommendation`, `concession`) are required in the output JSON object.**
* `claim`: (string) The specific critique point regarding logical fallacies, linguistic imprecision, unverifiable assumptions, ambiguity, etc.
* `evidence`: (string) Explanation referencing specific steps and the principles of logical analysis, linguistic clarity, or empirical grounding being violated.
* `confidence`: (float) Agent's confidence in this critique (0.0-1.0).
* `severity`: (string) Estimated impact ('Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Critical').
* `recommendation`: (string) A concrete suggestion to improve logical clarity, linguistic precision, define terms, provide evidence, or simplify structure.
* `concession`: (string) A brief acknowledgement of practical constraints, common usage, or contextual factors that might explain the presence of the critiqued element, despite its logical or linguistic imperfection (e.g., "While 'user-friendly' lacks precise definition, it serves as common shorthand in UI design discussions," or "Direct empirical proof of this causal link might be impractical, so reliance on established correlation is understandable."). If no concession seems appropriate, state "None".

**Output Format Example (Illustrates structure only, not required content):**
```json
{{
  "claim": "Step 2 uses the vague term 'enhance significantly' without defining the metric or baseline for significance.",
  "evidence": "The word 'significantly' is ambiguous and subjective. It's unclear what constitutes a significant enhancement, making the step's success criteria unverifiable. The underlying proposition lacks clear logical form.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "severity": "Medium",
  "recommendation": "Replace 'enhance significantly' with a precise, measurable goal, such as 'increase metric X by at least 15%' or 'reduce error rate Y below Z threshold'.",
  "concession": "However, the initial exploration phase might intentionally use vaguer terms before specific metrics can be established."
